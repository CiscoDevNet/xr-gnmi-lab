    "\n",
    "#### gRPC overview\n",
    "gRPC is a framework dedicated for connecting services and it offers support for load-balancing, tracing, authentication and health-checking. For example, we could use gRPC to connect front-end applications with backend services or to connect management systems with network elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In gRPC, we define a service using protocol buffers (protobuf).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### gRPC transport\n",
    "\n",
    "gRPC is based on the HTTP/2 transport protocol and it has support for Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs). These are operations that can be called remotely with a set of given parameters and they can return information back to the requestor. The following categories of RPCs exist:\n",
    "- Unary RPC - the client sends a single request to the server and receives a single response back (e.g. polling information).\n",
    "- Server streaming RPC - the client sends a request to get multiple streams of information from the server (e.g. model-driven telemetry); the client can wait for the completion marked in the metadata by the server.\n",
    "- Client streaming RPC - the client sends multiple streams of information to the server; the server typically sends a single response back\n",
    "- Bidirectional streaming RPC - streaming of multiple read-write streams between the client and the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### gRPC implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The communication between the server and the client is established through a gRPC channel formed between the hosts. Therefore, we require the specification of the IP address and the port of the host for the server. A client could modify the traits of a channel (enable / disable compression of a message) and could monitor the state of the channel. \n",
    "\n",
    "The server side contains the implementation of the abstract service and will handle RPC calls and encode the responses. The client side contains the implementation of the same service and can call the methods on the gRPC channel established between the client and the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### gRPC authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of network management, gRPC supports SSL/TLS authentication. It is also possible to add custom authentication methods by extending the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The client uses SSL/TLS authentication to authenticate to the server and to encrypt the messages. There is also an option to use certificates for authentication. The SSL credentials are attached to the gRPC channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Protobuf\n",
    "\n",
    "The payload message transferred through the RPCs may be encoded in protobuf. Note that it is also possible to use alternative encoding formats, such as JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "Protobuf is a form of binary serialization with which one can encode an abstract concept (such as a service) in a structured way. The format is similar to XML format but said to be simpler, smaller and hence more efficient. The extensions of a service are backwards-compatible with older versions of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a protobuf file, one can generate bindings in various programming languages for the implementation of the underlying service described in the proto file. Proto files usually also have data structures defined in them which describe messages that are transferred with the RPC calls. Due to this definition, we can avoid hand-parsing the messages that are passed along. All these mean that we can transition from an abstract concept and automatize the utilization of that concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "<mark>NOTE</mark> - For a reference on the gNMI service definition, see its corresponding protobuf definition at: https://github.com/openconfig/gnmi/blob/master/proto/gnmi/gnmi.proto.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### gNMI\n",
    "\n",
    "gNMI is dedicated for managing and monitoring the state of network elements. It supports:\n",
    "- Configuration management and retrieval\n",
    "- Operational state retrieval\n",
    "- Bulk data collection via Model-Driven Telemetry (MDT)\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the configuration is performed by the management system (client) that has read-write permissions and is applied to the network element (target). \n",
    "\n",
    "The messages within the gRPC service are defined as protocol buffers. The data has to be structured in a tree-like structure, similar to YANG models, and it has to be addressable by paths within that tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### gNMI data payloads and paths\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, gNMI carries instances of YANG schemas but it can be used to carry data of other types of structures. In any case, a node will be identified by a path within the structure's tree and its value will be serialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### gNMI RPCs\n",
    "\n",
    "The gNMI RPCs sent between the client and the server are:\n",
    "- Capabilities RPC - learn about the features supported by the network element.\n",
    "- Subscribe RPC - a bidirectional streaming RPC; the data can be sent as soon as it is available and hence avoids overloading the network element.\n",
    "- Set RPC - a unary RPC; it is sent by the client to update the state of the target (update / delete / replace).\n",
    "- Get RPC - a unary RPC; it is sent by the client to ask a snapshot of the target's state (configuration / operational)."

    "The gRPC Remote Procedure Call protocol is a newer protocol than NETCONF. It is the result of the adoption of microservices in new architectures. The switch from monolithic applications to ones with distributed components has encouraged the development of the gRPC, and later, of the gNMI protocols. These protocols allow for frequent and efficient RPCs in the microservices systems and they work over HTTP/2.\n",

A gNMI service will carry payloads that are instances of YANG data models in its attempt to manage or retrieve the underlying information. The values for each instance of the data model are serialized using JSON, Protobuf, Bytes, ASCII or JSON_IETF encoding.\n",
